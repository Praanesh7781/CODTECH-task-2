**Project Overview**

**BUILDING A SERVERLESS APPLICATION WITH AWS LAMBDA**

This project demonstrates the creation of a serverless application using AWS Lambda. The goal is to provide an understanding of serverless computing and how to build applications without the need to manage servers.

**Project Description**

In this project, you will learn how to create a serverless application on AWS through the following steps:

**Create an AWS Lambda Function:**

Log into the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
Click on "Create function" and choose "Author from scratch."
Provide a function name and choose a runtime, such as Node.js, Python, etc.
Configure function permissions by creating a new role with basic Lambda permissions.
Click "Create function" to create the Lambda function.

**Write and Deploy the Lambda Function Code:**

In the Lambda function's code editor, write your function code.
You can also upload a .zip file or use an S3 bucket for larger deployments.
Configure the function's handler and runtime settings as needed.
Click "Deploy" to save and deploy the function.

**Set Up API Gateway:**

Navigate to the API Gateway service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Create API" and choose "HTTP API" or "REST API" based on your requirements.
Create a new API and configure the routes and methods (GET, POST, etc.).
Integrate the API with the Lambda function by specifying the Lambda function ARN.
Deploy the API and note the endpoint URL.

**Test the Lambda Function via API Gateway:**

Use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
Verify that the Lambda function is triggered and responds correctly.

**Monitor and Optimize:**

Navigate to the CloudWatch service to monitor the Lambda function's performance.
Check logs, set up alarms, and optimize the function's performance based on insights.

**Technologies Used**

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Lambda

API Gateway

CloudWatch

**Conclusion**

This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the basics of serverless computing with AWS Lambda. It covers essential skills in writing, deploying, and managing serverless functions, serving as a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore serverless architecture.
